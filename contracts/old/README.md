I started with writing the solidity contract for implementing the required functionality for Polymer's challenge. 

The contract includes an operator registry and a multisig mechanism that operates across the Optimism and Base Sepolia networks using the Polymer Hub.

### Operator Registry and Multisig Contract

This contract consists of two main parts:
1. **Operator Registry:** Manages node operators’ addresses and signatures across both chains.
2. **Multisig Contract:** Handles cross-chain multisig transactions using Polymer’s infrastructure.

### Explanation:

1. **OperatorRegistry Contract:**
   - Manages the list of operators.
   - Provides functions to add, remove, and check operators.

2. **CrossChainMultisig Contract:**
   - Manages cross-chain transactions using Polymer’s infrastructure.
   - Operators can submit, confirm, revoke, and execute transactions.
   - Includes a function for cross-chain submission of transactions using Polymer Hub.

### Key Points:

- The `CrossChainMultisig` contract utilizes `OperatorRegistry` for operator management.
- The contract ensures that only registered operators can manage transactions.
- Transactions require a minimum number of confirmations (`required`) to be executed.
- Cross-chain transaction submissions use Polymer Hub's `sendPacket` function.

This implementation serves as a foundational component for integrating AVS technology for secure and efficient cross-chain operations.
