To implement the event handling for the `CrossChainMultisig` contract, I made the following key changes in the updated contract :

1. **Event Handling**: The contract now emits additional events related to AVS verification and slashing:
   - `AVSVerificationRequested`: Emitted when a new transaction is submitted, to notify the AVS system.
   - `AVSVerificationResult`: Emitted when a transaction is executed, to notify the AVS system about the execution result.
   - `AVSSlashingInitiated`: Emitted when the contract initiates the slashing process on the AVS system.

2. **AVS Integration**: The contract includes a new internal function `initiateAVSSlashing` that can be called to initiate the slashing process on the AVS system. This function uses the `getOwnersForTransaction` helper function to retrieve the owners who confirmed the transaction.

3. **Submission and Execution**: The `submitTransaction` function now emits the `AVSVerificationRequested` event to notify the AVS system about the new transaction. The `executeTransaction` function now emits the `AVSVerificationResult` event to notify the AVS system about the execution result.

4. **Counters**: The contract uses the `Counters` library from OpenZeppelin to manage the transaction IDs.

With these changes, the `CrossChainMultisig` contract is now capable of interacting with the AVS system on Holesky.

The AVS system can monitor the events emitted by the contract, verify the transactions, and initiate slashing if necessary.
